## Introduction

UTeM Shuttle Tracking System is a system that can help ease UTeM’s shuttle monitoring. As this system will monitor buses available for the student to see. Sometime, shuttle or bus go to each bus stop with only a few or no one in the bus. This cause a gas wastage and time wastage as no one uses the bus. With this system deploy it will help significantly in saving money from waste of oil and money. As we all know diesel vehicle will produce a lot of smoke that will cause air pollution with this system it will also help the environment, meaning by collecting threshold of the student in a bus stop in UTeM‘s area driver doesn’t need to go to a bus stop empty handed knowing that there will be someone there.

Problem that usually face by the student is they don’t know when the shuttles arrive. Tentatively there is a time but sometime bus didn’t arrive at the designated time. This will cause student to wait without knowing where their shuttle. Sometime student waits for a long time just for a shuttle to arrive. This is because there is no shuttle tracking system in UTeM. With this System it will help in monitoring bus movement, student that uses the app able to use this application in monitoring bus movement, student that uses the app able to use this application to insert threshold this will tell the driver a student is waiting at the bus stop.

This system will also be one of the steps to smart campus by efficiently saving cost, diesel, environment and time. Things in university will be easier with this system student able to organize their time before shuttle arrive. 

## Features

-	Register in the system.
-	Edit user’s profile. 

### Students
-	Able to see the location of the bus.
-	Register in the system
-	Log into the system
-	Edit user’s profile

##	Software Requirements
The software requirements that have been used for this project are:
1.	Android Studio: IDE use to code the native system.
2.	Firebase: to store data such as user personal information and current location of the bus driver.

With this system having backend using Firebase it is a cross-platform solution for Android, iOS, and web applications. Firebase can be use at no cost at all, which is why it is prefer by most developer.  With it easy to store and sync data without knowledge of SQL cloud database. Data is synced across all clients in real-time and remains available when application goes offline. Firebase Real-time database is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in real-time to every connected user. Firebase is a fully managed platform for building iOS, Android, and web apps that provides automatic data synchronization, authentication services, messaging, file storage, analytics, and more. Starting with Firebase is an efficient way to build or prototype mobile backend services.
